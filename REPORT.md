## Report

- This project was built using `vuejs v2` as well as a css framework `BulmaCSS`.

- I also make use of a css library to render the date range picker for the search input field.

- Data used/rendered in the assignment were extracted from the final result provided in the resource file which was later arranged in a format that suits my use case('An array of objects').

- Two different components were created for both the mobile view and the desktop view while the formatted data were passed down to each components as props.

- The components switches based on the current width of the screen.
